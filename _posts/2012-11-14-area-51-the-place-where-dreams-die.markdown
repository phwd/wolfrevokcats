================

tldr; Stack Exchange Area 51 (http://area51.stackexchange.com/) sucks big time and everyone knows it

<sub>Thanks for stopping by!</sub>

Though, seriously, check this:

*If you thought the App Store review process was hell, wait till you try making a proposal on Area 51*

<blockquote>If your area of expertise doesn't already have a Stack Exchange site, propose it! Stack Exchange sites are free to create and free to use. All we ask is that you have an enthusiastic, committed group of expert users who check in regularly, asking and answering questions.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
The creation of Stack Exchange sites is a democratic, community-driven process. That does not mean the majority of Area 51 users have to love your site idea. It simply means you have to recruit a community of users large enough so that questions get good answers quickly. Reach out to other experts to build support for your site; bloggers, enthusiasts, and support groups can all benefit from a world-class, canonical collection of expert answers to the hardest questions.</blockquote>

Let me highlight some key points

* check in regularly (as in everyday) or you wouldn't ever know when your proposal is closed or deleted. *There is no notification, ever.*

* check discuss.area51.stackexchange.com because it's the only way to check who is discussing your proposal without your knowledge. *The creation of Stack Exchange sites is a democratic, community-driven process.* As in, every single user regardless if they follow your proposal or not can burn it to the ground. Very democratic is it not?

* gain rep otherwise you cannot do a lot of features like editing or closing questions. *How do you gain reputation?* By dumping questions in other proposals you have no interest in 

* so you have finally reached the commitment stage, now it's time to sign up to existing Stack Exchange sites to get 200+ rep needed

The commitment score is the minimum of three scores:

X% X/200 committers in total  
Y% Y/100 committers with 200+ rep on any other site  
Z% commitment score, based on committers' activity on all other sites and how old the commitment is  

Time for more dumping of content we have no interest in

* so you are out the gate, congratulations, you have now entered private beta period, where it is tested once again whether you have what it takes to reach public beta. Your scope will change at least three times in this period and there is nothing you can do about it.

If you made it this far, you are now in public beta, the eternal state. 

There are current 55 sites in public beta, the oldest in this state at 833 days. That's right 833 days and the site hasn't touched the sweet smell of being a full fledged site.

This isn't for the weak, it's survival of the fittest, a political mini battle in discuss.area51.stackexchange.com and even then you may just get stuck on localization. http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/36960/chinese-emigration

If you want your proposal out the gate, you better have the enthusiasm to back it up, because it's not easy, at all.
