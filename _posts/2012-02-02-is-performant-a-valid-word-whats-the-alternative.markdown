Given that [performant isn't officially a real word](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2007/05/10/performant-isn-t-a-word.aspx), what is an appropriate alternative term for expressing "something that performs well"? So, instead of saying something like,

> This iteration of the SQL query is particularly performant.

What would you say instead?

Or how about:

> We're going to go with the most performant, yet ugly, code.

Or this:

> Then there's V8, a particularly perfomant new Javascript engine.

To me, saying *well-performing* instead of *performant* feels ugly, inelegant and inefficient. Stylistically, and subjectively, I prefer the look and sound of performant.  
<br>
So, should we just go ahead and use the word? After all, the beauty of the English language is that it is not set in stone and does indeed evolve at a fairly rapid pace.  
<br>
I realise this question may not be strictly about programming, but I've only ever heard the term used by programmers or technical writers in a technical context. So I wanted to hear the perspective of a programming community, rather than a language community. I also thought it might be a decent experiment to ask this sort of question during the beta period.  
<br>
Note, I personally voted-up some of the better counter-arguments, even though I agree with the argument of @harpo, whose answer I accepted. I think it's important for people to vote-up thoughtful, well reasoned answers, rather than just up-voting opinions they agree with, and down-voting opinions they disagree with.

**Update: Stephen Fry has published a podcast discussing language and the use of new words:
[Stephen Fry's Podgrams Series 2 Episode 3, Language](http://www.stephenfry.com/2008/12/22/series-2-episode-3-language/)
Interesting to anyone with an interest in this sort of thing.**

"Performant" <em>is</em> a "real" word &#8212; we all know what it means.  
<br>
Remember that the dictionary is a retroactive record of how words are used, meaning that words become words before they make it there.  Dictionaries are descriptive, not prescriptive.  In other words, they describe how words <em>are</em> used; they do not prescribe how words <em>should be</em> used.  
<br>
I might add that comprehensive dictionaries of English have existed for less than 150 or so years, and that "performant" will appear in a future one.  
<br>
Update: By the way, "performant" is just a French formation of "performing."  It came about through inflection, as new forms often come about, when the desire arose for a single adjective equivalent to "well-performing."
